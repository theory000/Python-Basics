**For Loop in Python:**

A `for` loop in Python is used to iterate over a sequence (such as a list, string, or range) and execute a set of statements for each item in the sequence.

**Example:**

fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
for fruit in fruits:
    print(fruit)

In this example, the `for` loop iterates through the `fruits` list, and for each item (`fruit`) in the list, it prints the value. The loop continues until all items have been processed.

For loops are commonly used for tasks that involve repeating actions for each element in a sequence.
