Comments provide explanatory notes in code. They're not executed but aid programmers in understanding. For example:

# This is a comment explaining the following code
variable = 5

Comments enhance code readability and collaboration.

Comment shortcut: To comment a line without typing `#`, you can use the shortcut `Ctrl + /` or the VS Code universal shortcut `Ctrl + C` followed by `Ctrl + U`.

Multi-line comments are created using triple single quotes `'''...'''` or triple double quotes `"""..."""`. They can span multiple lines and are often used for adding explanations or notes to code.
Example:
'''
This is a multi-line comment.
It provides context or explanations.
'''
print("Hello, world!")
We can also use " instead of '
