Escape sequence characters are special combinations of characters that are used in strings to represent certain non-printable or reserved characters. They begin with a backslash `\` followed by a character code, and they are used to include characters that are hard to type or might be misinterpreted within a string.

For example:

`\n` represents a newline character.
`\t` represents a tab character.
`\"` represents a double quotation mark character.
`\'` represents a single quotation mark character.
`\\` represents a literal backslash character.

Here's a brief explanation of each:

`\n`: Inserts a new line.
`\t`: Inserts a tab.
`\"`: Inserts a double quotation mark.
`\'`: Inserts a single quotation mark.
`\\`: Inserts a backslash.

Usage example:

print("This is a new line:\nAnd this is a tab:\tEnd.")
print("He said, \"Hello!\"")

Output:
This is a new line:
And this is a tab:    End.
He said, "Hello!"

Escape sequences make it possible to include special characters in strings without causing syntax errors or unintended behavior.
