**Nested if-elif-else Statements**:

- Nested if-elif-else statements allow you to create more complex decision-making structures in Python.

- You can have if-elif-else blocks inside other if-elif-else blocks.

- They help you handle multiple conditions and execute specific code based on the first condition that evaluates to true.

**Example**:

if condition1:
    # Code block 1
    if condition2:
        # Code block 2
    else:
        # Code block 3
elif condition3:
    # Code block 4
else:
    # Code block 5

**Explanation**:

- If `condition1` is true, it enters the first `if` block and checks `condition2`. Depending on the result, it executes either code block 2 or 3.

- If `condition1` is false and `condition3` is true, it enters the first `elif` block and executes code block 4.

- If none of the conditions are met, it executes code block 5 inside the `else` block.

**Use Cases**:

- Nested if-elif-else statements are useful when you need to handle multiple conditions in a structured way, making your code more organized and readable.
