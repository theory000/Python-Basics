MODULES:
Modules prevent reinventing the wheel by leveraging existing, expert-tested solutions, ensuring error-free functionality.

Modules allow us to reuse existing code. There are two types:
1. Built-in Modules: Pre-existing in Python, no installation required.
2. External Modules: Written by others for our use.

Pip:
Pip serves as a driver fetching groceries, or modules, from the internet market and delivering them to usâ€”installing modules in a nutshell.

Module installation involves using pip.

Utilizing our initial module:
1. Access the terminal (ctrl + `) and enter 'pip' for a list of pip commands.
2. Install our first module with 'pip install pandas'.
3. This installs our first module, 'pandas'.
