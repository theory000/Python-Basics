Here are examples of each type of operator:

1. **Arithmetic Operators:**
x = 10
y = 3
addition = x + y
subtraction = x - y
multiplication = x * y
division = x / y
floor_division = x // y
remainder = x % y
exponentiation = x ** y

2. **Comparison Operators:**
a = 5
b = 8
is_equal = a == b
not_equal = a != b
less_than = a < b
greater_than = a > b
less_equal = a <= b
greater_equal = a >= b

3. **Logical Operators:**
p = True
q = False
logical_and = p and q
logical_or = p or q
logical_not = not p

4. **Assignment Operators:**
num = 10
num += 5  # Same as num = num + 5
num -= 3  # Same as num = num - 3
num *= 2  # Same as num = num * 2
num /= 4  # Same as num = num / 4

5. **Bitwise Operators:**
bitwise_and = 10 & 3   # Bitwise AND
bitwise_or = 10 | 3    # Bitwise OR
bitwise_xor = 10 ^ 3   # Bitwise XOR
bitwise_not = ~10      # Bitwise NOT
left_shift = 10 << 2   # Left shift by 2 bits
right_shift = 10 >> 1  # Right shift by 1 bit

6. **Membership Operators:**
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
is_present = 3 in numbers
not_present = 6 not in numbers

7. **Identity Operators:**
x = [1, 2, 3]
y = x
is_same = x is y
is_not_same = x is not y

8. **Ternary Operator:**
age = 18
status = "Adult" if age >= 18 else "Minor"

These examples should help clarify how each type of operator works in Python.
