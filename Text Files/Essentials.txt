In programming, we use the 'print' function to display content in our program. For example:

print("Hello, world!", 5)  # Output: Hello, world! 5
print(4 + 6)  # Output: 10

Python executes code sequentially, line by line. This means each line is processed in the order it appears in the program.

You can also print the results of mathematical functions:

print(2 * 3)  # Output: 6
print(10 / 2)  # Output: 5.0

This showcases the basic usage of the 'print' function and how Python processes code step by step.
