The `sep="~"` argument in `print("hey", 6, 7, sep="~")` sets the separator between printed values as a tilde (~) character.

Example:
print("apple", "banana", "cherry", sep="~")

Output:
apple~banana~cherry

In this example, the values "apple", "banana", and "cherry" are printed with a tilde (~) as the separator.

End:
The `end=""` argument in `print("Hello", end="")` specifies what character or string to append at the end of the print statement instead of the default newline.

Example:
print("Hello", end=" ")
print("World")

Output:
Hello World

In this example, the `end=" "` ensures that the second `print` statement is appended with a space instead of a newline, resulting in the words "Hello World" being printed on the same line.
