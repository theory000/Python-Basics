**Range Loop in Simple Terms:**

A range loop is a way to repeat a block of code a specific number of times. It's like saying, "Do this thing a certain number of times." 

**Explanation:**

- **Syntax**:

  for i in range(start, stop, step):
      # Code to repeat

- `start` is where you want to begin.
- `stop` is where you want to stop (not inclusive).
- `step` is how much you want to move by (optional, default is 1).

**Example:**

for i in range(1, 6):  # Starts at 1, stops before 6, with a step of 1 (default)
    print(f"Hello, number {i}!")

**Output**:

Hello, number 1!
Hello, number 2!
Hello, number 3!
Hello, number 4!
Hello, number 5!

In this example, the loop runs from 1 to 5 (inclusive) and executes the code inside the loop for each of those numbers. It's a simple way to repeat a task a known number of times.
