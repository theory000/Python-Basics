**Loops in Python:**

Loops in Python allow you to execute a block of code repeatedly. There are two main types of loops in Python: `for` and `while`. Here's a brief explanation of each with examples:

1. **For Loop:**
   - A `for` loop is used to iterate over a sequence (e.g., a list, tuple, or string) or other iterable objects.
   
   **Example 1: Looping through a list**
   fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
   for fruit in fruits:
       print(fruit)

   **Example 2: Looping through a range of numbers**
   for num in range(1, 6):  # Prints numbers from 1 to 5
       print(num)

2. **While Loop:**
   - A `while` loop continues executing a block of code as long as a specified condition is `True`.

   **Example: Counting from 1 to 5 using a while loop**
   num = 1
   while num <= 5:
       print(num)
       num += 1

These are the two primary types of loops in Python, and they are used for different looping scenarios. `for` loops are ideal for iterating over sequences or a known number of iterations, while `while` loops are suitable when you want to loop until a specific condition becomes `False`.

**NESTED LOOPS**

**Nested Loops in Python:**

Nested loops refer to the situation where you have one loop inside another loop. This allows you to perform more complex iterations.

**Example: Nested For Loops**

for i in range(3):
    for j in range(2):
        print(f"({i}, {j})")

Output:
(0, 0)
(0, 1)
(1, 0)
(1, 1)
(2, 0)
(2, 1)

In this example, the outer loop iterates over `i` from 0 to 2. For each `i`, the inner loop iterates over `j` from 0 to 1. This results in a total of 6 iterations, producing all combinations of `(i, j)`.

Nested loops are useful for working with multi-dimensional data or when you need to perform operations on each element in a nested structure (like a list of lists or a grid). They can make it possible to work through complex patterns and relationships within your data.
