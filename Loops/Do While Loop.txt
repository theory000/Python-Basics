A do while loop is a control flow statement that executes a block of code at least once, then repeatedly executes the block of code as long as a given boolean condition is true.

Here is an example of a do while loop in Python:

number = 0

do:
  print(number)
  number += 1
while number < 10

This loop will print the numbers from 0 to 9. The first time the loop executes, the condition `number < 10` is true, so the body of the loop is executed. The body of the loop simply prints the value of `number`. Then, the control flow goes back to the beginning of the loop and the condition is checked again. This process continues until the condition becomes false, which is when `number` is equal to 10.

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any other questions.
