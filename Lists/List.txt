**Python lists** are a collection of data that can be of any type, such as numbers, strings, objects, or even other lists. Lists are ordered, meaning that the items in the list are stored in a specific sequence, and mutable, meaning that the items in the list can be changed after it is created.

To create a list, you simply place the items in the list inside square brackets (`[]`). For example, the following code creates a list of numbers:

```python
my_list = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
```

You can access the items in a list using their index. The index of the first item in the list is 0, and the index of the last item in the list is `len(list) - 1`. For example, the following code prints the first and last items in the `my_list` list:

```python
print(my_list[0])
print(my_list[len(my_list) - 1])
```

You can also add, remove, and insert items in a list using various built-in methods. For example, the following code adds the number 6 to the end of the `my_list` list, inserts the number 1.5 between the first and second items in the list, and removes the number 1.5 from the list:

```python
my_list.append(6)
my_list.insert(1, 1.5)
my_list.remove(1.5)
```

Lists are a very versatile data structure in Python, and they can be used to store all sorts of data. For example, you could use a list to store the names of your friends, the items in your shopping cart, or the high scores in a video game.

Here is an example of how to use a list to store the names of your friends:

```python
friends_list = ["Alice", "Bob", "Carol"]

# Print the list of friends
print(friends_list)

# Add a new friend to the list
friends_list.append("Dave")

# Remove a friend from the list
friends_list.remove("Bob")

# Check if a friend is in the list
print("Alice" in friends_list)
```

Output:

```
['Alice', 'Bob', 'Carol']
['Alice', 'Carol', 'Dave']
True
```

Lists are a powerful tool in Python, and they are used in many different types of programs.
